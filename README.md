The original game of Bomberman is played by going around the grid placing bombs to break down destructible walls. Under one of these destructible walls is the door to the next level. There is also an enemy AI (Artificial Intelligence) that tries to attack the player. This game has been adapted and turned into a multiplayer game. In this updated version, the opponent players will be visible in the same grid but will have different layouts for the destructible walls. Players can also place bombs across systems, which will explode only in the opponent grid. The goal of the game is to kill the opponent players by placing these special bombs.
